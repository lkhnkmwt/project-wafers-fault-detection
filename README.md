# project-wafers-fault-detection
Hey! This is a project helpful at the industrial level.
A wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used in assembly line.
In this project we are analyzing the data of sensors which are tracking these wafers , and predicting whether the wafer is faulty or working fine so that we can easily reach to the assembly line and easily change that particular wafer.
To predict this, we need to provide the path of csv file containing sensor data.


If you wanna read about step by step procedure of project, you can read 'wafers fault detection.txt' in this repository.


# Running app
First install all libraries and modules using requirements.txt file
To open the web application in your browser, run app.py file in your local system and you will see the link of local server running, copy that link and paste in your browser.
You will be able to see the screen eager to take the path of files as input.
Provide the path of sensor's data. ('Prediction_Batch_files' in our case) and submit.
The output file will be saved at 'Prediction_Output_file' folder.
