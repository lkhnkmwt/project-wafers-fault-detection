# project-wafers-fault-detection
Hey! This is a project helpful at the industrial level.
A wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used in assembly line.
In this project we are taking the data of sensors which are tracking the progress of these wafers, and predicting whether the wafer is faulty or working fine so that we can easily reach to the assembly line and easily change that particular wafer.
