# project-wafers-fault-detection
Hey! This is a project helpful at the industrial level.
A wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used in assembly line.
In this project we are analyzing the data of sensors which are tracking these wafers , and predicting whether the wafer is faulty or working fine so that we can easily reach to the assembly line and easily change that particular wafer.
To predict this, we need to provide the path of csv file containing sensor data.
